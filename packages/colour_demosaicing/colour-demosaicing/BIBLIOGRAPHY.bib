    component at each pixel by means of their color filter array (CFA)
    covering the CCD sensor. To obtain a color image, a procedure -
    called demosaicing - is then necessary to estimate the other two
    missing color components at each pixel. This chapter deals with
    the quality of color images generated in such a way. We attempt to
    determine which demosaicing method provides the best results
    according to several comparison criteria, particularly for
    subsequent needs of color image analyses like edge detection.},

  abstract     = {{$<$}p{$>$}This paper introduces a new interpolation
    technique for demosaicing of color images produced by single-CCD
    digital cameras. We show that the proposed simple linear filter
    can lead to an improvement in PSNR of over 5.5 dB when compared to
    bilinear demosaicing, and about 0.7 dB improvement in R and B
    interpolation when compared to a recently introduced linear
    interpolator. The proposed filter also outperforms most nonlinear
    demosaicing algorithms, without the artifacts due to nonlinear
    processing, and a much reduced computational
    complexity.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract     = {Most digital cameras use a color filter array to
    capture the colors of the scene. Downsampled versions of the red,
    green, and blue components are acquired, and an interpolation of
    the three colors is necessary to reconstruct a full representation
    of the image. This color interpolation is known as demosaicing.
    The most effective demosaicing techniques proposed in the
    literature are based on directional filtering and a posteriori
    decision. In this paper, we present a novel approach to this
    reconstruction method. A refining step is included to further
    improve the resulting reconstructed image. The proposed approach
    requires a limited computational cost and gives good performance
    even when compared to more demanding techniques.},
